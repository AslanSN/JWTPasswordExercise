### Styles

I used a Bootwash Morph theme for Bootstrap to styled all the components.

### Views (Components)
I just added and deleted the components as I needed.


### Back-End Manual Installation:

It is recomended to install the backend first, make sure you have Python 3.8, Pipenv and a database engine (Posgress recomended)

1. Install the python packages: `$ pipenv install`
2. Run the application: `$ pipenv run start`

If it doesn't work you should run `$ pipenv shell` and then try again **step 2**.

### Front-End Manual Installation:

-   Make sure you are using node version 14+ and that you have already successfully installed and runned the backend.

1. Install the packages: `$ npm install`
2. Start coding! start the webpack dev server `$ npm run start`
